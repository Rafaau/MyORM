**MyORM** is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) designed for .NET developers who want to use a simple and rapid way to interact with databases. It is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entityframework6/what-is-entityframework.aspx).
